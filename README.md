# restmvcnetapi

This was me building my first REST API with the ASP.NET Core MVC framework. It was also my first experience with .NET and C#. Also used is a Microsoft SQL server for backend (w/SSMS).

I learned about dependency injection, the Entity Framework Core (DBContext), DTOs, RESTful API guidelines, testing API endpoints with Postman, and deploying an RDS with SQL Server Express and SSMS.

### Below is an image describing the overall architecture.

### I used the Swagger UI for my API, so below are two snapshots of what the finished app looks like.
